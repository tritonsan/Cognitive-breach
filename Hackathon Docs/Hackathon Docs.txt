Welcome to the era of Gemini 3.
Google DeepMind is thrilled to invite you to the Gemini 3 global hackathon. We are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do by enhancing reasoning capabilities, unlocking multimodal experiences and reducing latency. Now, we want to see what you can create with our most capable and intelligent model family to date.

Whether you are a seasoned AI engineer or writing your first line of code, this is your invitation to build the future. We are looking for more than just another chat interface. We want to see fun, creative, next-generation applications built with the Gemini 3 family

Why participate?
Be First: Get hands-on access to the Gemini 3 API before the rest of the world catches up.

Build Something New: This challenge is strictly for new applications. It’s a level playing field for everyone.

Win Big: We have a prize pool of $100,000 + interviews with the AI Futures Fund team for an opportunity to fund your project.

Requirements
What to Build
The prompt is simple: Build a NEW application using the Gemini 3 API. There are no category restrictions. Build a game, a productivity tool, a scientific analyzer, or a robotic controller. If it uses Gemini 3 to do something cool, we want to see it! For inspiration, check out the Resources tab!

What to Submit

Text description describing the Gemini Integration - A brief write-up (~200 words) detailing which Gemini 3 features were used and how they are central to the application.
Public Project Link: A URL to your working product or interactive demo. Consider using AI Studio apps, which are the fastest way to build prototypes using the Gemini API. 
This allows judges to experience your project firsthand, if applicable. It should be publicly accessible and not require a login or paywall.
URL to your PUBLIC code repository - required if you do not have an AI Studio link to your project
~3-minute demonstration video - judges may not watch beyond 3 minutes

Gemini 3

Vibe Coding in AI Studio

 
Inspiration: 
Need a spark? Start here. Gemini 3 isn’t just a chatbot—it’s a multimodal reasoning engine. It can see, hear, and understand the world in real-time. Don't just build a text interface; build something that senses and reacts.

The launch of Gemini 3 signals the start of the Action Era, transitioning from static chat to autonomous agents that plan and execute complex, long-running tasks. This global hackathon, hosted by Google DeepMind and Devpost challenges you to build high-fidelity AI-powered applications using the Gemini API.

 

We strongly discourage the following types of projects: 

In the Action Era, if a single prompt can solve it, it is not an application. We are looking for orchestrators building robust systems using the Gemini API in Google AI Studio.


Baseline RAG: Gemini 3 Pro features a verified 1M token context window. It natively reasons over entire codebases and document sets; simple data retrieval is now a baseline feature.
Prompt Only Wrappers: Applications that are merely system prompts in a basic UI.
Simple Vision Analyzers: Basic object identification is obsolete. We want to see spatial-temporal video understanding that recognizes cause and effect.
Generic Chatbots: Standard bots for nutrition, job screening, or personality analysis.
Medical Advice: No projects generating medical or mental health diagnostic advice.
 

Strategic Tracks:
These tracks focus on market potential and technical depth. We encourage you to innovate beyond these prompts to showcase the full potential of Gemini 3 Pro.

🧠 The Marathon Agent: Build autonomous systems for tasks spanning hours or days. Use Thought Signatures and Thinking Levels to maintain continuity and self-correct across multi-step tool calls without human supervision.

☯️ Vibe Engineering: Leverage the Google AI Studio Build tab and Google Antigravity. Build agents that do not just write code but verify it through autonomous testing loops and browser-based verification artifacts.

👨‍🏫 The Real-Time Teacher: Use the Gemini Live API to synthesize live video and audio for adaptive learning.

🎨 Creative Autopilot: Combine Gemini 3 reasoning with Nano Banana Pro for high-precision multimodal creation. Use higher resolution and localized Paint-to-Edit controls to generate professional, brand-consistent assets with legible text

Judges may be employees of the sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the sponsor.  

The Submissions will be evaluated by the Judges in the following Stages:

Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Submission meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Submission includes all Submission requirements, reasonably addresses a Challenge, and reasonably applies the requirements.

Stage Two: All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two by the Judges based on the following weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the Judges. Each Submission will receive a score from 1 to 5 per criterion and those criterion scores will be averaged per Submission.

Technical Execution - 40%
Does the project demonstrate quality application development? Does the project leverage Gemini 3? Is the code of good quality and is it functional? 
Potential Impact - 20%
How big of an impact could the project have in the real world? How useful is the project to a broad market of users? How significant is the problem the project addresses, and does it efficiently solve it?
Innovation/Wow Factor - 30%
How novel and original is the idea? Does it address a significant problem or create a unique solution? 
Presentation/Demo - 10%
Is the problem clearly defined, and is the solution effectively presented through a demo and documentation? Have they explained how they used Gemini 3 and any relevant tools? Have they included documentation or an architectural diagram?
The highest-scoring Submission for each category will be selected as the potential winner(s). The highest-scoring Submission across all categories will win the Grand Prize. Ties will be broken by comparing scores on each criterion in the order listed, and if a tie remains, judges will vote. If a potential winner is disqualified, the Submission with the next highest score will become the potential winner. Determinations of judges are final and binding.

The award of a prize to a potential winner is subject to verification of the identity, qualifications and role of the potential winner in the creation of the Submission. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website. The final decision to designate a winner shall be made by the Sponsor and/or Administrator. A Submission can win a maximum of one prize. In the event that no entries are received for a region, no prize will be awarded.

On or about March 2, 2026, the potential winner(s) will be selected and may be notified by email, at Sponsor’s discretion for Winner Verification Requirement (as defined below). If a potential winner does not respond to the notification attempt within two days from the first notification attempt, then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein.  Except where prohibited by law, each potential winner may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by Sponsor.  If required, potential winners must return all such required documents within two days following attempted notification or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected based on the judging criteria described herein. All notification requirements, as well as other requirements within these Rules, will be strictly enforced.

The public Winner Announcement will be on or around March 4, 2026. 

“Winner Verification Requirement” means THE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website. The final decision to designate a winner shall be made by the Sponsor and/or Administrator.

Determinations of judges are final and binding.
